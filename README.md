### Automated Machine Learning using mljar

The mljar-supervised is an Automated Machine Learning Python package that works with tabular data. It is designed to save time for a data scientist. It abstracts the common way to preprocess the data, construct the machine learning models, and perform hyper-parameters tuning to find the best model üèÜ. It is no black-box as you can see exactly how the ML pipeline is constructed (with a detailed Markdown report for each ML model).

#### The mljar-supervised will help you with:

1. explaining and understanding your data (Automatic Exploratory Data Analysis),
2. trying many different machine learning models (Algorithm Selection and Hyper-Parameters tuning),
3. creating Markdown reports from analysis with details about all models (Automatic-Documentation),
4. saving, re-running and loading the analysis and ML models.
